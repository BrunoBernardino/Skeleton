# Skeleton

Forked from the original https://github.com/dhgamache/Skeleton, this is just a version of Skeleton custom-tailored for what I usually use and need.

It has a few extra things like:

* icon-font
* retina-images support
* different directory structures
* jQuery + underscore in an example

## TODOs

I still want to:

* Make the buttons slightly different (less contrast and bigger)
* More default button size options
* More default input size options
* Use http://conditionizr.com/
* Use percentages and ems instead of fixed px values
