# Skeleton

Forked from the original https://github.com/dhgamache/Skeleton, this is just a version of Skeleton custom-tailored for what I usually use and need.

It has a few extra things like:

* Icon-font
* Retina-images support
* Different directory structures
* jQuery + underscore by default
* Uses http://conditionizr.com/
* More button options (colors and sizes)
* More input sizes
